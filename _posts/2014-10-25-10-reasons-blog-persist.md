#### This great infographic is from Mark W. Schaefer. 

I found this today from Mark's website, very impressed! Like to post here to share with everyone. I agree all 10 reasons, those are very helpful. Especially I like the reasons about "3. Improved Skill Set", "6. Content Library" and "Product Development."

I had read Mark's book "BORN TO BLOG", it has more blogging inspiration and detail guidence around blogging. It is the number one book on blogging in the world. Be sure to get this book from Amazon if you want to be a good blogger. It is highly recommanded!
