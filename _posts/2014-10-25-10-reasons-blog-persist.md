### I found this great infographic today from Mark W. Schaefer website, very impressed! I like to post here to share with my readers.

I agree all 10 reasons, those are very helpful. Especially I like the reasons about "3. Improved Skill Set", "6. Content Library" and "Product Development."

### I had read Mark's book "BORN TO BLOG", it has more blogging inspiration and detail guidence around blogging. I agree it is the number one book on blogging in the world. Be sure to get this book from Amazon if you want to be a good blogger.
